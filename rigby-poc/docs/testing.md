# Running the tests

The suite is hermetic. It needs no server, no browser, no API key and no network.
That is a property worth protecting, so it is stated here and enforced by
`tests/test_invocations.py`.

## The invocations

| What you want | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Everything (the default) | `uv run pytest` |
| One file | `uv run pytest tests/test_full_body_motion.py` |
| One test | `uv run pytest tests/test_full_body_motion.py::test_walk_forward` |
| Frontend | `npm --prefix frontend test` |
| Frontend type-check | `npm --prefix frontend run build` |
| Coverage (rarely — see below) | `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon uv run pytest --cov=rigby_poc --cov=evals` |

Tiering markers (`fast` / `medium` / `slow`) arrive in PR 09b; this file gains the
`-m` invocations then.

## Coverage is not on by default, and must not become so

`addopts` is `-q` only. Neither `.pth` hook in site-packages is active:
`a1_coverage.pth` needs `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` / `COVERAGE_PROCESS_CONFIG` and
`pytest-cov.pth` needs `COV_CORE_SOURCE`. None of those are set, so a plain
`uv run pytest` does no line tracing.

Keep it that way. Measured on `test_action_sequences.py`, adding
`--cov=rigby_poc --cov=evals` takes it from 5.93 s to 23.42 s — a **3.95×**
multiplier, almost all of it tracing the 7,815-line `compiler.py`.

Two rules follow:

1. **Never add `--cov` to `addopts`.** `tests/test_invocations.py` fails the suite
   if anyone does. Coverage belongs to the scheduled job, not to the inner loop.
2. **Always set `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` when you do run coverage.** That selects
   Python 3.12's `sys.monitoring` backend instead of the `settrace` one and
   removes most of the multiplier. The nightly CI job sets it.

## Why no secrets are needed

Verified, and re-verified on 2026-08-24 against `dfac5c1`:

- `tests/backend_contracts.py` drives the API through
  `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`, which is in-process ASGI. Nothing binds a port.
- `evals/capture.py` imports Playwright at module scope, so Playwright must be
  *installed* for tests that import it, but no test calls `sync_playwright` — the
  only two call sites are `evals/capture.py:1294` and
  `evals/render_demo_gif.py:127`, and every test injects `capture_fn=fake_capture`.
- `judge.py` imports `OpenAI`, but every test injects a fake client. No test reads
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The measurement: the full suite passes with `OPENAI_API_KEY` unset, no `.env`
present, and every `AF_INET`/`AF_INET6` socket raising on construction.

**CI therefore needs no secrets, and must not be given any.** A CI job that
carries an API key can start depending on one without anyone noticing.

MuJoCo is the only hard external dependency, and only for grasp and pickup
intents. It is a wheel, not a service. Note that importing it shells out to
`sysctl` on macOS, so an offline guard must block sockets rather than
subprocesses wholesale.
